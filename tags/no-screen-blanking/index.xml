      <description>There are some things in Xorg that I specifically like to set to better fit my needs. This is a list of my current settings that I like.
Disabling Mouse Acceleration One of the things I dislike is mouse acceleration. I like having a high mouse sensitivity, and having mouse acceleration on adaptive just slows it down and makes mouse movements inconsistent. At some point I was looking into how to turn it off, and then later I forgot where I put it because it was in some odd file besides what everyone else was saying.</description>
